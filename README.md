# Fantasy Premier League Season Review
### React, Fantasy Premier League API & DB   

Review your FPL season with this website, and see stats that the officials don't show you!

### Things to keep in mind:   
This will need to be adjusted for seasons past 19/20   
Also, need to adjust for the final gameweek (should just be a numerical adjustment somewhere)   
Can break sections into functions later, but for now this is good as an MVP   
Optimize this, this can be way quicker   
Some variables don't need to be stored on the client before updating state   
Make loading prioritized so the things that take less time are displayed first, keep in mind that the piechart will break if you update before the variables are ready

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
