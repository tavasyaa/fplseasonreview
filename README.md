# Fantasy Premier League Season Review
### React, Fantasy Premier League API & DB

### Things to keep in mind:   
This will need to be adjusted for seasons past 19/20   
Also, need to adjust for the final gameweek (should just be a numerical adjustment somewhere)   
Can break sections into functions later, but for now this is good as an MVP   
Optimize this, this can be way quicker

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
